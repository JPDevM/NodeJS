- Install NodeJS and ExpressJS.

- Create Folder structure.

- Set Express.

- Definition of MVC entities.

- MVC: Create Routes.

- MVC: Modularize and create routes files (entities).

- MVC: BREAD entities.

- MVC: Create controllers files.

- MVC: Tell routes the controller method.

- MVC: Create the controller standard methods.

- In this part of the process the control methods should show the results. The database is in charge of displaying the results.

- `1. a` [Edit the methods of the controller from the database.md](./1.%20a.%20Edit%20the%20methods%20of%20the%20controller%20from%20the%20database.md).

- `1. b` [Edit the methods of the controller using JSON files.md](./1.%20b.%20Edit%20the%20methods%20of%20the%20controller%20using%20JSON%20files.md).

Another option is to send the views directly instead of the API, in this case with EJS as template engine.

- `1. c` [MVC: Tell the controller to show the views](./1.%20c.%20MVC%20Tell%20the%20controller%20to%20show%20the%20Views.md).
